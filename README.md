## Wine-Quality-Prediction-Using-Random-Forest-Model
1. Download the dataset here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
2. It is preferable to use Google Collab
3. Import all the dependencies : numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, train_test_split, RandomForestClassifier and accuracy_score
4. Load the dataset to a Pandas Dataframe
5. Check the number of rows and columns in the dataset
6. Check the first 5 rows of the dataset
7. Check the missing values
8. Perform statistical measures of the dataset
9. Check the number of values for each wine quality
10. Plot bar graph of volatile acidity vs quality to check for correlation between them
11. Plot bar graph of citric acid vs quality to check for correlation between them
12. Constructing a heatmap to understand the correlation between the columns
13. Separate the data and label
14. Perform test and test split
15. Perform model training by using Random Forest Classifier
16. Check for model evaluation
17. Build a predictive system
